# MAP RELATED STUFF

# Relative probabilities for each terrain type to appear on
# the map. Currently, Open terrain is four times more likely to
# appear than forest. The values are relative (discrete distribution).
# For example, 5 and 20 would produce the same map as the values
# below. If you add more terrain types, adding them here
# will cause them to appear on the map. Terrain generation
# is completely random. There's no fancy procedural content gen.
# algorithms here. If you want something fancier, you'd need
# to add them below and call them in game_map.py.
