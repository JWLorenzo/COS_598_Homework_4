# COS_598_Homework_4

# Notes:

- Towers generate units based on surrounding units

- Evaluation of movement "worthness" based on distance to a given unit and the distance to a given tower.

- Economy? 
    - The more of a unit that exists, the cheaper they are

- Ideas: 

    - Builders
        - Roadmakers that create optimal paths from a given place to another place so towers can manuever terrain with ease.
    - Medics
        - Heal other units
    - Mages
        - Grant other units flight so they can move on other unit tiles and ignore terrain
